	<h2>Margaret "Meg" O'Neill was killed after pushing another ice climber while climbing in Utah. Another climber was injured, but O'Neill was the only fatality.</h2>
	<p><strong>By Emily Olsen</strong></p>
	<p> An ice climber sacrificed her own life to save another climber in Utah on Sunday, according to local authorities.<br><br>
		Three climbers were attempting to ascend the frozen Raven Falls near Indian Canyon when the formation broke and collapsed, according to a press release from <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/people/Duchesne-County-Sheriffs-Office/100064574928585/" target="_blank">the Duchesne County Sheriff's Office.</a><br><br>
		One climber, a 34-year-old male who has yet to be named by authorities, fell approximately 40 feet but survived, and was transported by helicopter to a local hospital with serious injuries.<br><br>
		A second climber who police later identified as Margaret "Meg" O'Neill pushed a third person, her 21-year-old companion, out of the way of the falling column. The move "probably saved her life," the sheriff's office said. The 21-year-old was able to climb down and drive to find enough cell phone reception to call 911.<br><br>
		Search and rescue crews were on the scene until 5 p.m. local time on Monday, <a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/one-ice-climber-missing-one-rescued-in-duchesne-co-accident" target = "_blank">reports Fox 13 News.</a> They found O'Neill's body "trapped underneath two huge blocks of ice," according to the sheriff's office.<br><br>

		"Our sincere condolences to all effected by this tragedy, to the family of this brave, courageous woman who lost her life while saving another," the office added.<br><br>
		O'Neill, age 43, served as <a href = "https://embarkoutdoors.org/our-vision" target = "_blank">Assistant Director for Embark Outdoors</a>, a nonprofit facilitating outdoor sports and education for refugee women and girls.<br><br>
		"Most of our girls have known Meg for half their life. She'd been a mentor to them since 7th grade. She was the heart and soul of this program, as you all well know,"<a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqlx9XUviQm/?hl=en" target = "_blank"> Embark wrote in an Instagram post</a> on Tuesday.<br><br>
		In comments, others remembered O'Neill as "the epitome of a community leader â€” the most badass advocate" and a "champion for every woman and girl in the outdoors."<br><br>
		In an interview with Fox 13, Embark's Executive Director Camille Fiducia said O'Neill had an impressive climbing resume and plenty of outdoors experience, but <a href = "https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/one-ice-climber-missing-one-rescued-in-duchesne-co-accident" target = "_blank">her true passion was being of service to others.</a><br><br>
		"If all of us could be one-eighth of what Meg's attitude of service was, what a change that could be," she said.<br><br>
